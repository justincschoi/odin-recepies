    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>These chocolaty cookie bars are somewhat of a cross between a brownie and a cookie, with a flavor reminiscent of
        Mexican hot chocolate. They're best if you err on the side of under- versus over-baking.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon instant espresso powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon strong brewed coffee</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¼ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup firmly packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Toppings</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8-inch square pan with enough parchment paper
            to have overhang on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir espresso powder and coffee together in a small bowl until espresso powder is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cocoa, cream of tartar, baking soda, salt, and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon together in a bowl; set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Beat butter, 1/2 cup white sugar, and brown sugar with an electric mixer together until light and fluffy in
            a bowl. Beat in espresso mixture, egg, and vanilla until well combined. Stir in flour mixture; mix until a
            dough just begins to form. Press dough firmly and evenly into the prepared pan using lightly floured hands.
        </li>
        <li>Whisk 1 tablespoon white sugar and remaining 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon together in a small bowl; sprinkle sugar
            mixture evenly over the dough.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven just until the dough in the center of the pan feels barely set, 20 to 23 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Allow cookies to cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Use the overhanging parchment to lift cookies out to a wire
            rack; cool completely before cutting into bars.</li>
    </ol>
